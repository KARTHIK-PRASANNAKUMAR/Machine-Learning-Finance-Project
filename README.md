# Machine-Learning-Finance-Project
This project optimizes investment portfolios using CAPM and quadratic programming. It covers data gathering, CAPM regression for asset analysis, and covariance matrix building. A smart optimization model determines ideal investment mixes, visualized by the "efficient frontier" graph. It's a clear method for effective portfolio building.
